## Getting back into my projects

Over the past several months I've outlined a few software / computer science-y projects I want to do. As I perenially suffer from "jack of all trades" syndrome, I haven't made much progress on any, as I keep finding new things to read about and feel excited about and have a hard time sticking with one thing for a while. The goal of this blog post is simply to reconsolidate my project ideas.

### Languages I want to learn

 - C
 - Common Lisp
 - Go

Out of these three languages, the "practical" choice in terms of career advancement, living in the "now" etc. would be Go.

However, for better or worse, "practical" isn't always very high on my list of things I care about.

C and Lisp are both super interesting to me in terms of their historical significance and the potential impact that learning them will have on the way I think, and the way that I program in "practical" languages.

Anyway, I've been __very__ slowly working through both [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) and [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io) and have been enjoying both a lot. Both very very high quality textbooks on software and programming in general, beyond their specific subject matter.

### Projects I want to do

 - Write a Markdown parser
 - Implement a hash table structure from scratch.


I've blogged a bit about trying to do the hash table in C. I think this is still a good goal. My data structures course at Brooklyn College wasn't very good and it was a long time ago, so I think it's worth giving myself data structures homework, and giving myself practice in building something "real" in C at the time time. It could be cool to reimplement my hash table structure in Go once I'm done, too. 

The Markdown parser, on the other hand, I think would be a good project to do in Lisp. I read somewhere that Lisps are good for implementing recursive descent parsers, which makes intuitive sense to me, I think.

A fun incentive for completing the Markdown parser is that I will be able to replace [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) with my own parser in my [static site generator](http://davep3rrett.info/posts/2018-10-30-makefile-static-blog-generator.html) that powers this very blog!! I will feel the power of my code that much more, every time I rebuild my blog. Awesome.

### Conclusion

Anyway, that's it. This was just a quick post to recap what I want to do in my free time / self-study time over the next couple of months. Hopefully this will be useful in holding myself accountable and getting myself to actually do stuff! See you next time.
