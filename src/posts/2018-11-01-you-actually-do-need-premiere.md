# You actually do need Premiere

I just wanted to write a quick note refuting [my post](2016-05-31-ffmpeg.html) from two and a half years ago. Unfortunately, you really do need proprietary, non-free software to do any kind of less-than-trivial video editing. :~{

On a lighter note, I'd like to take this opportunity to plug [this music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2ZawlzVPw) I made for my band this year (sadly without directly using ffmpeg from the shell, or even using openshot). I actually learned a thing or two about using Adobe Premiere - frighteningly close to a marketable skill... &#x1f631;
