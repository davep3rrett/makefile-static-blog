## Preamble / Ramble on Learning Vim, Learning C, and Implementing a Hashmap for Self Edification and Mind Expansion

Hello and welcome to my first programming blog post in more than two years! After a year of doing lots of front end web development work, my itch to do computer science-y, Unix greybeard-y things has intensified.

I've been wanting to learn Vim forever (I spent some time in Emacs a couple years ago, but finally gave it up, as I was stagnating at a level of ability that wasn't high enough for real productivity, and suffering from a lack of desire to continue down that particular rabbit hole, for whatever reason) - and I've actually finally begun learning it!

I'm typing this post in Vim, have been forcing myself to use it at work for small / quick code edits, have added a bit to my `.vimrc` and have started using a plugin manager (I went with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) although I see that [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) also seem to have some serious devotees).

I've also been wanting to learn to program meaningfully in C - I've decided to finally sit down and chug through Zed Shaw's [Learn C The Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/). After buying the course and checking out a couple of the videos, I noticed that Zed edits in Vim in the videos. This was an added impetus for me to learn Vim and also made it feel like C programming and Vim probably go hand-in-hand (at least maybe moreso than zillion-file Node.js ecosystem frontend web framework hellscape projects and Vim).

Lastly, I was just recently thinking that implementing a data structure like a hashmap / associative array would be a cool non-trivial C project to attempt. It would up my (currently very weak) data structures game, cause me to learn about different hashing functions, and most definitely level up my C abilities.

After a bit of searching, I found this nicely written up [tutorial](https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table). My plan right now is to not directly follow this tutorial, and purposely not really read it unless I'm really stuck on something. I think it will be more valuable / educational / impression-making on me if I do the fumbling and scrounging for resources on the various disciplines required for the project on my own, and then synthesize my findings on my own. But I will keep the aforementioned guide handy in case I'm stuck or want to cross-reference something I'm doing against how the tutorial author did it.

Anyway, I'm calling this post a 'preamble' in addition to calling it a 'ramble' because I want to use it to kick off what will be a series of subsequent posts about my findings as I dive into this project / amalgamation of sub-projects.

That's it! See you next post (hopefully before two more years from now)!
